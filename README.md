## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

I learned that I would stop planning and write code on the fly during the middle of development, which is a really bad practices because it took me way more time than actual to finish the target.

I also learn about regex and the usage of it in the code.

### Continued development

I would like to explore BEM methodology more because this is the second project I use BEM only, and I have to admit that I did not do good enough to organize the CSS code.

I learned that my fundamental for JavaScript still not strong enough even though I have studied it for months now... I think it is because of the lack of experiences. I would invest my time more in self-learning in website like The Odin Project to completely conquer Javascript.
